## When we talk about "traditional IT infrastructure," we're referring to physical servers and equipment that companies used to buy and keep in their own buildings, known as on-premises data centers. Let's explore why this setup can be tricky:
·       It's like a long relay race: Many different people are involved, passing the baton from one to another. This can slow things down and sometimes the baton gets dropped.
·       Waiting for your turn on the swings: Just like waiting in line at the park, setting up new hardware takes time. You can't play (or deploy new services) until it's your turn.
·       Piggy banks might not be enough: Starting this kind of IT setup can cost a lot, like saving up for a really big toy. And the costs keep coming, like needing new batteries or parts to keep the toy running.
·       Playing Tetris with servers: Adding more servers when you grow can be like trying to fit new blocks into a game of Tetris. And if you need less? You might be stuck with extra blocks (servers) you paid for but can't use.
·       It's a lot to keep tidy: Just as toys need to be cleaned and fixed, servers need regular maintenance, which can be a lot of work.
